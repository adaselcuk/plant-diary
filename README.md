# Online Plant Diary

I am making an online plant diary to improve my web development experience. I am looking forward to learning user authentication, security, databases (such as MongoDB), and improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Target Audience
This website will mainly be aimed at home gardeners and plant keepers who need a place where they can keep track of their plant routines and ask for help if their plant is not in the best shape.
Amateur botanists will especially have an interest in this due to their beginner knowledge of plants.
